Ingredients:

For the Pizza Dough:

2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast
1 teaspoon sugar
3/4 cup warm water
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon olive oil
For the Pizza Sauce:

1 cup tomato sauce
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
Salt and pepper to taste
For Topping:

2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
Fresh basil leaves (optional)
Red pepper flakes (optional)
Instructions:

Prepare the Dough:

In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.
In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil.
Mix until the dough comes together. Turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.
Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a clean cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-1.5 hours or until doubled in size.
Prepare the Pizza Sauce:

In a small bowl, mix the tomato sauce, dried oregano, dried basil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Adjust the seasoning to taste.
Assemble the Pizza:

Preheat your oven to 450¬∞F (230¬∞C).
Roll out the risen dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness. Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza stone or baking sheet.
Add the Sauce and Cheese:

Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.
Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.
Bake the Pizza:

Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for about 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
Serve:

Once the pizza is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it cool slightly before slicing.
Garnish with fresh basil leaves and red pepper flakes if desired.
Enjoy your delicious homemade cheese pizza!
